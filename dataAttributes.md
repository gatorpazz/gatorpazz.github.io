I've been wanting to use data attributes for the longest time in my code, so I decided to do a bit of research about them and present my findings here.  

So what the fuck are data attributes? Well data attributes are attributes you can pretty much make up a name for and use it to store information that doesn't have a defined meaning in a semantic way. All you have to do to declare data attributes is use the form `data-(ANYTHING)`.

You can set this data attribute equal to anything you like but it's typically for info that doesn't have any sort of visual representation on elements.
