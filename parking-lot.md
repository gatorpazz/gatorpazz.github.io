Topics I really really want help on

1. I can make an HTML template. I can clone it and add it into my HTML with javascript fairly proficiently. I am not understanding how to edit the values of it before it is activated into the HTML and the documentation is not helping.

2. I understand the thought of the model in MVC, I get that it's sort of the bones behind the view that move everything. But I'm definitely not using it right. I want to see a fully fleshed out application effectively using it so I can improve my stupid looking code.

3. A way to better add eventListeners dynamically was mentioned in class that sounds more efficient than mine. I would like another round of looking at event bubbling to make this work.

4. Learn about HTML data attributes!!!!!
