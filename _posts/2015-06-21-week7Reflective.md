So for week 7 we got our creative handcrafted and totally unique side on with giant online website Etsy. We took the API for Etsy and had to create our own version of the webpage that listed categories and product details and all kinds of crap. What's more we had to make another group project which I thought was pretty cool since the one that Ben and I had done was pretty good. This project was on a whole other level of suckitude.

First off I'll say that despite my last post, I no longer hate APIs. I actually have a pretty good understanding of them now. It's the replacing the data part with them that is the awfulness. I understood the long way we did it with $.getJSON and assigning a variable with the data needed then replacing that data one piece by one piece. I understand the basic parts of this new technology Vue.js to replace chunks of it. But grabbing large pieces of data that's nested inside the original data and trying to replace multiple parts of the data was a huge pain in the ass. I'm serious we did a lot of stuff, filtering the data out, trying to call only certain fields of it, it just wouldn't work. But overall we did get the page looking pretty damn good, you might have thought the website was actually Etsy till you realized you couldn't click on any of the links or do anything.

For the group project we had a team leader and three code monkeys. The team leader wasn't supposed to code. On the first day I was team leader and nobody coded on the first day anyways so it was sort of a waste. I imagine it's probably a good position if done right, but I didn't care. During the weekend one of our group members didn't show up to any of our meetups for the project so we just made him the team leader so the rest of us could actually work. And we STILL had the best looking project. Baller!
