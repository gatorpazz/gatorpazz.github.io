Week 5 kinda sucked and it sucked even worse that I typed out a whole god damn journal entry about it on gitHub and enjoyed the wonders of the Iron Yard's wifi. Fucking shit. Anyways it was nice to review all the old stuff and I know people were feeling shakey about continuing onwards but I think I would have much preferred pushing forward with APIs and all the material that we are now covering in week 6.

Do I feel like my classmates are holding me back though? Not at all. I'm sure the majority of them are much better at git than myself. Many of the noncoding tasks seem to elude me that they tend to pick up faster. However when you put me to coding, especially javascript, things tend to just click and I get in the zone.

One thing I did like was the week's project. We recreated Octocat's profile, which took a bit of each of the prior projects. I did it though, the HTML, the CSS, the javascript. I did every bit of it myself and it looked pretty damn good on mobile. If I hadn't been goofing off Saturday with my buddy I might have been able to get the desktop view done as well. Oh well, what can you do? Onwards to Week 6!
