So for week 3 we learned all about the magical world of CSS. In all honesty I thought it was pretty great because CSS makes a lot of things that would be difficult or tedious to do in HTML or Javascript way more streamlined.

This week I felt has been a very welcome break thanks to the two day conference and the Monday Memorial Day Break. I was able to slow down and really take the time to shore up some shakey foundations in gluing all the pieces of web application development together in a coherent form. I was able to work through a lot of code school and code academy and really started getting the hang of jQuery and even adventuring to parts of unknown wilderness.  

In terms of CSS, there are many parts that I understand and many parts that I don't. The code school courses touch upon the basics of it, but I haven't worked my way to the more advanced CSS courses to better understand the concepts of positioning elements on a page. Things like position and float still confuse me and it's something I'll have to build upon to better my skills.

The conference itself was an adventure, a vacation, and a really good learning experience. Through it I saw a lot of the differences between designers and developers and learned a lot of fundamentals about what is important in making functional web applications that not only worked well but also ran fast. I even picked up a little nugget about using svg images in my code (INTO THE PARKING LOT WITH YOU!). However I think the most important part of the conference was getting to know the members of my cohort better and be able to help them with their stuff and there's no better feeling than that. On the other hand I also learned things about members of my cohort that I should probably take to my grave X_X. But enough of that, I am filled with renewed vigor to go forward and attack week 4 and beyond.
