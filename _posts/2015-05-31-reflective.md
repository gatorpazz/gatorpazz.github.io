#Chessboard Extravaganza

During week 4 a new project came that was the bane of my existence, a freakin chessboard that moves through a set of moves (that hopefully one day moves back). Sounds simple right? WRONG!!!!! One thing I will say that I'm proud of is that we built every scrap of this thing ourselves, no blueprints ripped off from the internet. I might still have needed a bit of help getting started, but I understood what was explained made many pieces of it by myself.

Another project I worked on was a form sheet called MultiColumnForms. This project had a page which had a form that you could fill out. It was responsive and shrunk down to two columns and then down to one column depending on viewport size. I really enjoyed this project. Unlike the other blueprints I didn't copy any code from this project. I built every bit of it by myself, with zero help from anyone else and I'm proud of that. It still has some quirks with the CSS, but that just reflects my need to go on codeschool and complete the more advanced CSS course to really nail that aspect down.

Life is tiring. Week 5 is supposed to be either a push forward all or nothing week or a review week. After careful and chaotic deliberation between our cohort, we settled onto the decision to have a review week. I'll admit I was disappointed. But at the same time I couldn't forgive myself if one of the members of my cohort fell so far behind that they were at the point of no return. Oh well, it'll be good to buckle down and really hit home on the fundamentals during week 5.
