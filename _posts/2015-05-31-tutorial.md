# Javascript Objects and You

Since my classmates don't seem to like javascript so much, I decided to do my tutorial on a rather advanced javascript concept.  

My chessboard project was made with objects during the weekend and it was sucky, a big struggle. I'm pretty sure the objects came out good though so I'll show you the constructor I made them with.  

First we declare a var:

```javascript
var piece;
```

So good so far, but we gotta put something in it. This will be our constructor.

```javascript
var piece = function (filePlace, rankPlace) {
```

Now that weird looking function is a function expression. This is fancy talk for an anonymous function (has no name) that is assigned to a variable. This function is what will construct our objects when we invoke the piece variable. We have to fill it now.

```javascript
var piece = function (filePlace, rankPlace) {
      this.fromFile = board.file[filePlace - 1];
      this.fromRank = board.rank[rankPlace - 1];
      this.toFile = null;
      this.toRank = null;
```

So what we have now are the actual properties that the created piece will have. The `this` part means that when we call the function with our object name, that object name will take the place of this and make the code very robust. Finally we might want a function that sticks solely to our object (a method) so we can stick it in our constructor too.

```javascript
var piece = function (filePlace, rankPlace) {
  this.fromFile = board.file[filePlace - 1];
  this.fromRank = board.rank[rankPlace - 1];
  this.toFile = null;
  this.toRank = null;
  this.move = function (a, b) {
    if (this.toFile == null) {
      this.toRank = board.file[a - 1];
      this.toRank = board.rank[b - 1];
      game.push([this.toFile, this.toRank]);
    } else {
      this.fromFile = this.toFile;
      this.fromRank = this.toRank;
      this.toRank = board.file[a - 1];
      this.toRank = board.rank[b - 1];
      game.push([this.toFile, this.toRank]);
    }
  };
};
```

This method changes the properties of the object. And that's how you make an object constructor.
