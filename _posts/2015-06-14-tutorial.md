So this weekend I had a lot of trouble with my project and I really wanna just focus on what went right. So my code could take text and turn it into a form that could be downloaded. This part of the project went swimmingly, and the code isn’t all that difficult either. Basically what we have to do is turn the text, which is in the form of a string, and turn it into what’s called a blob.

A Blob object represents a file-like object of immutable, raw data. Blobs represent data that isn't necessarily in a JavaScript-native format. The File interface is based on Blob, inheriting blob functionality and expanding it to support files on the user's system.

An easy way to construct a Blob is by invoking the Blob() constructor. Another way is to use the slice() method to create a blob that contains a subset of another blob's data.

From there we take the blob data and make something your computer download, which I did with this code:

```javascript
var textFile = null,
  makeTextFile = function(text) {
    var data = new Blob([text], {
      type: 'text/plain'
    });

    // If we are replacing a previously generated file we need to
    // manually revoke the object URL to avoid memory leaks.
    if (textFile !== null) {
      window.URL.revokeObjectURL(textFile);
    }

    textFile = window.URL.createObjectURL(data);

    // returns a URL you can use as a href
    return textFile;
  };

```
