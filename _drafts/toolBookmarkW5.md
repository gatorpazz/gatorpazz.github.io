My tool of choice for this week is HTML5 Boilerplate. The fact that this tool is used by many many people on many many well known websites attests to how good it is. Basically HTML5 boilerplate gives you a template for a project, providing you with common tools that you might use, predefined HTML, CSS, and JS pages, and a number of other things. You can take out what you want, or add more to your heart's content. It definitely helps give you a starter point where you might otherwise be clueless.
