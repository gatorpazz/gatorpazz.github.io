Rough Draft  

Seeing as we are coming onto the last week of lectures I feel like it is time to do my big shocking reveal that might explain a lot of things about myself. First off I want to tell my fellow classmates that over the course of these last 8 weeks I have been a very tired Michael. You may see me duck out early shortly after homework review quite often. The reason for this is that I need to go home and get the only sleep I get during the day, averaging 5-6 hours. Sean in particular has noticed these afternoon naps. What he did not know however is that after I wake up, Saturday through Tuesday night I work as a security guard from 11:00PM - 7:00AM. That's right, that old job I was telling you guys about? Never quit it. Why you might ask? I needs teh money to eat. Those times you walked in and saw me there super early? I just walked over from the Seaside Plaza building after work. Those times where I come in close to 9:00 AM? Most likely I probably took a 90 minute nap in my car in the morning.  

Now before you go and think that I'm some sort of robot cyborg that manages to shove coding into every free moment of my life (grain of truth in that though), take note that at my job I do have the time available to do a lot of my classwork which is why you'll often see commits from me ranging from 12:00AM - 5:00AM, most of my job is sitting at a desk and glancing at cameras, and it's dead quiet, very convenient for a good work environment. In fact I'm typing this journal right now at 1:49AM at my work desk. So it's actually a pretty sweet gig.

Pros to working during these past 8 weeks:  
  * I'm not starving
  * I get free parking downtown

Cons:  
  * You cannot imagine how fucking tired I am all the time
  * Not as much time to code
  * My house is a wreck from all the chores that continuously build

Now let me just say that I have been more tired in my life. Army boot camp is something that I'd rather saw my own leg off than repeat but it did prepare me to operate under this much stress and lack of energy. Oh boy does it suck though.  

We all do what we have to do to survive. The sleep deprivation is really starting to get to me though and week 8 was pretty much where I wavered and fell. Another group project yayyyy. This time we were making a gradebook. And man did I really let the ball drop. Every group project that we've had up to this point, despite my hatred of the difficulty at the time of those projects, really hadn't been so bad and the end result was something that I could be proud of. This project I was not proud of in the least. The manipulation of API data with lodash and feeding it to filters in Angular and trying to make it display in a good way oh my god kill me now. The only thing I can say about week 8's project is that I'm glad it's over. I wish I could have devoted more time to make it work, perhaps sometime in the future (as if).

I can say with all honesty though that these weeks have been ones that I'll remember for the rest of my life. All of my classmates are wonderful in their own special way and I am truly blessed by God for having known them and worked with them. I really don't have friends in Orlando and haven't really been able to branch out since I take online classes. By the way I also took and finished two three credit courses over the past eight weeks which started at the same time this coding boot camp did. Yes I'm really tired. Gatorpazz signing off.
