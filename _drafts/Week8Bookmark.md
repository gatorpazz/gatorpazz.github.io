My bookmark for this week is CodeSchool. It is an interactive website that helps teach languages, work flows, frameworks, and basically many of the basic concepts needed to become a software developer. It certainly won't get you to junior developer status, it's mainly to give you a good foundation. But a foundation is way better to build upon than straight dirt.
