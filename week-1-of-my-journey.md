Rough Draft

The past week was a difficult one. Though the material wasn't the clusterfuck that I thought it would be that would blow my brain out of the water, I was so sick that learning became a drag rather than a joy. I missed a lot of important information because I was too busy on focusing my concentration on not throwing up rather than learning the subtleties of CLI git commands. The javascript needed a quick refresher but thanks to the assignments given, my own personal review, and Dave's ever charming wit, it all came flowing back quickly. The git commands and the prezto took a little longer but soon my terminal was looking colorful and at the very least I wasn't a complete clutz with cloning, adding, committing and all that jazz. Eventually my sickness bottomed out and I learned to appreciate the members of my class and am looking forward to spending the next 11 weeks with them.

Final Draft

The first week was a challenging one for me. Though the material wasn't the clusterfuck that I thought it would be, stuff that would literally blow my brain out of the water, I was so sick that learning became a drag rather than a joy. I missed a lot of important information because I was too busy on focusing my concentration on not throwing up rather than learning to navigate through git on both github and the command line.

One day that stuck out to me was the lab time that happened after our homework review. Our instructor was going over how to use git commands in detail and I was just done with life. I had a blank stare on my face and everything was flying right over my head. Eventually I left early so that I could lay in bed and try to recover. When going through my assignments throughout the rest of the week I had no idea how to do anything with git in my command line and I was too humiliated to ask for help on something that we had received thorough instruction on that I was just unable to absorb thanks to my physical condition. I worked around this handicap by using the long route and downloading zip files for repositories and copy/pasting my work locally into github. Thankfully I didn't just let it ruin me and through the use of some tutorials online and codeschool's github course I was able to build up enough git to feel confident in what I was doing. I never want to feel that way again though, so I swore that I would always try to express my concerns and reach out for help.  

The javascript I had learned needed a quick refresher but thanks to the assignments given, my own personal review, and Dave's ever charming wit, it all came flowing back quickly. The magic that was prezto took a little longer but soon my terminal was looking colorful and at the very least I wasn't a complete clutz with cloning, adding, committing and all that jazz. Everything at least has some sort of foundation and although things are still shakey and less concrete than I might like, I am confident that it will all fall into place in my brain through continual practice and hard work. Eventually my sickness bottomed out and I learned to appreciate the members of my class and am looking forward to spending the next 11 weeks with them.
