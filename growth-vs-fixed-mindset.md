Dr. Dweck recently gave an interesting Ted talk on the mindsets of people, particularly students, and how it can affect our learning potential. Namely there are two principal mindsets mentioned, the growth mindset and the fixed mindset. By focusing on a growth mindset, we can expand our potential and foster creativity and learning within ourselves.  

In looking at these two mindsets we'll first start with the stifling mindset known as the fixed mindset. A fixed mindset is afraid of error and messing up. People with with a fixed mindset tend to view the outcome of something as the most important thing rather than the process and hard work necessary to reach such an outcome. Studies have shown the repercussions of this. In a study of kids who took a test, afterwards half were praised for their intelligence while the other half were praised for their hard work. Afterwards all of the kids were offered the same test to take or a harder one. Those who were praised on their intelligence didn't want to risk a harder test that might disprove their intelligence and stuck with the same one while those praised on their hard work wanted to challenge themselves.

The growth mindset is based on a mindset that one can improve themselves and develop their intelligence. Those with a growth mindset believe they can improve their skills with hard work and and effort. They don't feel the pressure that those with a fixed mindset do in that the outcome is the all or nothing goal and thus aren't afraid to mess up.  

My own personal experience throughout life has been one of a fixed mindset. My parents always praised me for being naturally smart because school came naturally to me. From a young age I was always considered a gifted child. When I got to high school that was no longer enough for some classes. Suddenly work and effort needed to be put in to achieve the desired result, things that I never really had to do before. My parents would question why my grades were slipping and still called me smart and drove home the importance of good grades. I faced a lot of pressure to achieve and didn't have qualms about cheating to make the grade because the grade was the only important thing to me.  

In my quest to be a good software engineer I will focus on hard work at the iron yard. There are no shortcuts to progressing in this field short of blood, sweat, and hard work. I will practice and practice till my finger tips callus and I see programming in my dreams.
