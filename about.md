I am just starting out in the world of software engineering. I've been at the Iron Yard for over 6 weeks and I've learned so much about programming and the real world skills needed to be a developer.  

## A Bit About Me

I am 22 years old, and a student at the Florida Institute of Technology. I am engaged to be married to the love of my life this upcoming December.
